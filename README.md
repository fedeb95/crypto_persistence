This project aims at replicating https://quantdare.com/demystifying-the-hurst-exponent/ findings after new data has become available. 

Possibly other methods for calculating the Hurst exponent will be included.

Since the API used only returns up to 2000 data points, calculations are made on two-days aggregates and not daily prices.
